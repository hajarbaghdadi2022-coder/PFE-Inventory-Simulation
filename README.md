# PFE – Inventory Simulation & Supply Policy Optimization

## 🎓 Final Year Project (PFE)

This project focuses on the **analysis and optimization of inventory management policies**
using **simulation and Monte Carlo methods**.

The objective is to compare and improve:
- (R, Q) continuous review policy
- (T, S) periodic review policy

by minimizing total cost while ensuring a high service level.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Industrial companies face frequent stock shortages or overstocking due to:
- Demand variability
- Lead time uncertainty
- Inappropriate replenishment policies

This project proposes a **data-driven simulation approach**
to identify optimal inventory parameters.
